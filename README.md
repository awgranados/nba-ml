# Player Points Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict the points an NBA player will likely score in their next game against a specific team. The model is trained on historical player statistics and incorporates weighted averages and feature engineering techniques. Additionally, a betting probability function can help evaluate the probability of a playerâ€™s predicted performance relative to a set betting line.
